FULTON COUNTY HOSPITAL is the “best hospital” considering all the measure scores included in all Timely and Effective Care and Readmissions data.Because different procedure and measures have different scales of scores, I had chosen a hospital’s percentage ranking of a particular measure as the indicator of how it compares with other hospitals. The percentage ranking ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 with 1.0 being the best. Because a hospital can have multiple measures, the average of its percentage ranking across all measures is used in final ranking.The advantage of such indicator is that it makes it possible to compare scores of different scale. The disadvantage is that hospitals have different number of measures in the dataset. The average of percentage ranking becomes less effective when some hospitals have a small number of measures that happen to have high percentage ranking. The query used to produce the included result sets a threshold of 10 measures when comparing the quality of care. This threshold is used to exclude some of the extreme data points so that the result is not easily skewed by hospitals that have small number of measures with high percentage ranking. Changing the threshold will result in different query result and potentially different “best hospital”Query result:h.hospital_name	avg_pctrank	stddev_pctrank	sum_pctrankFULTON COUNTY HOSPITAL	0.7360958729785156	0.19444137719621576	9.569246348720704FERRELL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS	0.702136814790331	0.15715608778887377	7.02136814790331DETROIT (JOHN D.
